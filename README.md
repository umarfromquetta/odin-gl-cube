# Description

OpenGL Cube Example In Odin Programming Language.
Feel Free to do whatever you want with the code but the images are from learnopengl.com.
This is just an example code for getting up and running with opengl in odin.
The code is overly commented for beginners like me, at the time of this upload i am 
a beginner programmer in general and also beginner in graphics programming overall.
There may be bugs in this code, but this code is not for production, it is just to get up and running and learn stuff.

# Running
Type "odin run main.odin -file" Or "odin build . -out=main.exe"
