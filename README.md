# Description

OpenGL Cube Example In Odin Programming Language.
Feel Free to do whatever you want with the code but the images are from learnopengl.com
This is just an example code for getting up and running with opengl in odin.
The code is overly commented for beginners like me, At the time of this upload i am 
a beginner programmer in general and also beginner in graphics programming overall.
there may be bugs in this code, but this code is not for production it is just to get up and running and learn stuff.

# Running
Type "odin run main.odin -file" Or "odin build . -out=main.exe"

# Why Odin Language
Odin is fast, low-level compiled language and best of all a simple language that has batteries included aka common popular libraries.
In other programming language like C/C++ you have to compile and link libraries manually. Which takes a lot of time and it is very hard for beginners. Rather than learning to Actually program, you waste a lot of time linking libraries and fixing issues.
In odin common libraries are included by default which you have to just import and use.
There are many great features about odin language like Data Oriented Design and manual memory management which you can find out yourself.
